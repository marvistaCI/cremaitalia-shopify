# Crema Italia — Shopify Theme

This repository contains the Shopify theme for **cremaitalia.com**, the storefront for
Crema Italia, LLC — a small selective importer of artisan Italian roasted coffee beans.
Owner: Steve. Operating entity: Crema Italia, LLC, Lutz, Florida, USA.

This `CLAUDE.md` is loaded into every Claude Code session in this directory. It is the
agent's persistent project memory. Update it whenever a meaningful decision is made;
treat it as the source of truth for "how we do things here."

---

## 1. Stage & posture

The store is **pre-launch**. A coming-soon landing page is currently live, designed to
capture email signups for a pre-opening newsletter. There is no product catalog yet and
no commerce flow active. The current priorities are:

1. Polish the coming-soon page (logo, founder story, brand voice)
2. Build out the foundational theme structure for the future full storefront
3. Keep the codebase clean and version-controlled so future changes are reversible

The owner is **not a modern programmer**. Communicate code changes in plain English
before showing diffs, and explain *why* a change is being made, not just *what*. When
making more than ~3 file edits in a single response, summarize the changes at the top
in plain language before listing the diffs.

---

## 2. Tech stack

- **Platform:** Shopify (storefront), domain pointed to `cremaitalia.com`
- **Theme:** Currently a coming-soon theme (zip in
  `<OneDrive>/CremaItalia LLC/Operations/In USA/shopify/Initial Site Build Out/`).
  The plan is to pull the live theme via `shopify theme pull` into this repo.
- **Language:** Liquid (Shopify's templating language), JSON (for theme settings &
  section schemas), CSS, vanilla JavaScript
- **Tooling on Steve's machine:** Node.js, npm, Shopify CLI (authenticated), Git
- **Editor:** Visual Studio Code recommended (lightweight, has Shopify Liquid extension).
  Note: Steve currently has Visual Studio (heavy IDE) installed; suggest installing
  VS Code separately if visual file browsing is wanted.
- **Version control:** Git (local repo), private GitHub remote for off-machine backup

## 3. Brand standards — condensed reference

The canonical brand standards live in `<OneDrive>/CremaItalia LLC/Brand and Marketing/`:
- `Crema_Italia_Brand_Standards.pdf` — the full spec (read this for any contested call)
- `Crema Italia Brand CSS.css` — the canonical brand stylesheet (drop-in for any HTML)
- `Logo Assets/` — all production logo variants (transparent, knockout, cup-only,
  hi-res, OG image, favicons)

### 3.1 Voice
Editorial. Considered. Like a fine-press book — NOT e-commerce loud. Plain, direct,
deferential. "We choose a small number of roasters whose work represents the craft of
Italian roasting at its best." NOT: "We hand-pick the world's most exclusive coffee
artisans." When in doubt: fewer elements, more whitespace, smaller logo, larger margins.

### 3.2 Color palette (use the role, not the hex name)
| Role             | Hex      | Where it lives                                |
|------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Background — Cream    | `#FBF8F1` | Page background, hero sections, document body |
| Surface — Ivory       | `#FFFFFF` | Tables, callouts, web cards on cream          |
| Espresso — Brown      | `#55331B` | Body text, H1, wordmark (artist palette 2026-07-01) |
| Espresso — Soft Brown | `#6B4A38` | Muted/secondary body, captions (interim; re-derive) |
| Crema — Gold          | `#B88348` | H2, accents, links, key numbers, button fills (artist palette 2026-07-01) |
| Crema Light           | `#E8A86A` | Hover states, light fills, chart shades (interim; re-derive from Crema Gold) |
| Tricolore Green       | `#0E7A3A` | Thin rules only (top-left page rule, etc.)    |
| Tricolore Red         | `#C8342B` | Thin rules only (top-right page rule, etc.)   |
| Hairline (neutral)    | `#D9D2C2` | Dividers, table borders                       |
| Mute (neutral)        | `#8C7E6A` | Footer text, page numbers, eyebrow labels     |
| Ink soft (neutral)    | `#5A4A3F` | Long-form body text where coffee is too heavy |

**Tricolore colors are decorative rules, NEVER large fills.** Think: a pencil-thick
rule across the top of the page, a 6mm strip at the foot of the cover. Never block
colors. Crema Gold is for headings >= 14pt/18px and short bold-weight runs only —
never run paragraph body copy in gold.

Do not introduce new colors. If a chart or feature seems to need a new hue, derive it
from Crema Light, Espresso, or a desaturated Tricolore Green.

> **Palette revised 2026-07-01 (artist rebrand).** The finalized logo's spec sheet
> (`Logo Assets/Art Files/CI Artwork Details.pdf`) sets Espresso Brown `#55331B` and
> Crema Gold `#B88348` as the two hero tones (replacing the old `#3B1F12` / `#C46A1F`).
> Green, Red, Cream unchanged. The muted `#6B4A38`, light `#E8A86A`, and hover `#9C6E3C`
> tokens are interim harmonizations — re-derive from the new hero tones when the Brand
> Standards PDF is rebuilt.

### 3.3 Typography
| Role                | Family                  | Weights         | Use                              |
|---------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------|
| Logo wordmark       | Montecatini Pro (Normale Semi-Bold) | — | Logo artwork ONLY — outlined in the files; commercial font, license unconfirmed |
| Display & Headings  | Marcellus               | 400 (Regular)   | Cover title, H1, H2, web/doc headings (Google Font stand-in for Montecatini) |
| Body & UI           | Inter                   | 400/500/600     | All body, tables, captions, UI, buttons, tagline |

Load from Google Fonts. Web sizes: Hero 72px, H1 40px, H2 18px, H3 16px, Body 17px,
Small/caption 14px, Eyebrow 12px (tracked +0.12em, uppercase).

> **Type revised 2026-07-01 (artist rebrand).** The wordmark is set in **Montecatini Pro
> (Normale Semi-Bold)** — a *commercial* font, already converted to outlines in the logo
> files, so the artwork needs no font install. This supersedes the old Cormorant-Garamond
> and the interim Lora display choice entirely. For live web/document headings use
> **Marcellus** (free Google Font, the artist's recommended stand-in). Body stays Inter.
> **TODO:** confirm Montecatini Pro licensing before using it for any live text beyond
> the outlined logo. Marcellus has a single 400 weight — headings rely on size, not bold.

Italic on display = Italian-language headings (English left, Italian right convention).
**Italics carry meaning** — don't italicize for emphasis. Use bold for emphasis.

### 3.4 Layout
- Max content width: 72ch for long-form, 1120px for landing pages
- Bilingual columns: English left, Italian right, italic for Italian H1s
- Header: thin tricolore rule across the top, logo on left at ~56px height
- Footer: hairline rule, then `Crema Italia, LLC - Lutz, Florida, USA - cremaitalia.com`

### 3.5 Imagery
Natural light, low saturation, narrow depth of field. Espresso cups, roasting drums,
hands at work, Tuscan landscape. NEVER: generic barista stock photos, vector
illustrations, emoji, decorative coffee-bean borders.

### 3.6 Bilingual posture
Roaster-facing artifacts ship in English AND Italian. Italian is the controlling
version when handed to an Italian roaster. Honor formal Italian address — use Voi/Vi/
Vostro, capitalized. Numbers and units: always include both metric (250 g) and US
customary (8.82 oz).

---

## 4. Logo & trademark

The mark is `Crema Italia(TM)`. We applied the TM mark today (June 2026) — Steve has not
yet filed with USPTO but intends to. TM goes after the final "A" in "ITALIA" as a small
superscript at cap-height. The `Logo Assets/` folder (restructured 2026-07-01) holds the
finalized artist mark with TM applied: master `.ai` in `Art Files/`, plus `EPS/`, `PDF/`,
`SVG/`, `PNG/`, and generated `Web/` derivatives — in main / horizontal / favicon lockups,
each in light and dark-background versions. **NEVER use the (R) symbol** until/unless
USPTO registration issues.

**Logo rules** (from brand standards):
- Clear space: at least the height of the wordmark "C" on every side
- Minimum size: 25mm print, 120px screen (favicon-only crop OK below 120px)
- On dark backgrounds: use the **dark-background lockup** (e.g. `PNG/CI Logo for Dark
  Background - Transparent.png`), not the light mark recolored
- Never stretch, rotate, drop-shadow, recolor the cup, or re-typeset the wordmark

---

## 5. File-naming conventions

Per brand standards: `Crema_Italia_<Topic>_v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.{docx|pdf}`
Logo files: `Crema_Italia_Logo_<variant>.{svg|png|jpg}`
Recommended variant naming for full asset library:
`<composition>_<colortreatment>` — e.g., `primary_color`, `primary_knockout`,
`wordmark_mono`, `cup_color`.

In code (Liquid sections, CSS classes, JS): kebab-case for file names (`hero-section.liquid`),
lowercase-with-hyphens for CSS classes (`.hero-section__title`), camelCase for JS.

---

## 6. Things to NEVER do

- **Never** introduce new brand colors beyond the palette above
- **Never** use tricolore green or red as large fills (only thin rules)
- **Never** recolor the espresso cup inside the logo
- **Never** re-typeset the wordmark; always use the supplied logo files
- **Never** apply the (R) symbol to the logo — Crema Italia is not federally registered yet
- **Never** push directly to the live store without committing to git first
- **Never** delete or rename anything under `<OneDrive>/CremaItalia LLC/` without
  asking — that's the operations folder, not the code folder
- **Never** use emoji in copy or commit messages (Steve hasn't asked for emoji)
- **Never** use "hand-picked," "world-class," "exclusive," or other e-commerce-loud
  language in brand copy
- **Never** italicize for emphasis (use bold); italics are reserved for Italian-language

## 7. Common commands

```bash
# Start local theme dev server (live preview with hot reload)
shopify theme dev

# Pull the current live theme down to local
shopify theme pull

# Push local changes to the live theme (be careful)
shopify theme push

# List themes on the store
shopify theme list

# Push to a NEW unpublished theme (safer for experiments)
shopify theme push --unpublished --json

# Git: see what changed
git status
git diff

# Git: commit a working state
git add -A
git commit -m "Concise message in present tense"

# Git: undo uncommitted changes
git checkout .

# Git: undo the last commit (keep changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Git: undo the last commit (discard changes)
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Git: push to GitHub
git push
```

---

## 8. Working workflow (the loop)

1. Make sure you're in a clean state: `git status` should be empty
2. Pull anything new from the live store: `shopify theme pull` (only if other people
   are editing in the Shopify admin; otherwise local is the source of truth)
3. Start the dev server: `shopify theme dev` — opens a localhost URL with live reload
4. Edit files (or have Claude edit them)
5. Review the change in the browser preview
6. If good: `git add -A && git commit -m "..."` to snapshot
7. When ready to deploy: `shopify theme push`
8. Push the git history to GitHub: `git push`

If something goes wrong: `git reset --hard HEAD~1` rolls back the last commit. Then
`shopify theme push` again to restore the store.

## 9. Architectural decisions log

Add a one-line note here whenever a meaningful decision is made. Format:
`YYYY-MM-DD — Decision in plain English. (Why)`

- 2026-06-23 — Initial scaffold. Tech stack: Shopify + Liquid + Git + Claude Code.
- 2026-06-23 — Brand standards from `Crema_Italia_Brand_Standards.pdf` v1.0 (May 2026)
  adopted as canonical.
- 2026-06-23 — Logo Option A (small superscript TM after wordmark) selected as the TM
  treatment.
- 2026-06-23 — Decided to defer SVG vector logo work; using raster (PNG) for all logo
  placements until a true vector exists. Reasoning: hand-coded SVG recreation didn't
  match the original closely enough; raster works for Shopify, OG, favicons, print at
  reasonable sizes.
- 2026-06-23 — Pulled live theme from Shopify into local repo as baseline commit.
  Theme name: `crema-italia-coming-soon-theme` (id #150557294761). Live at cremaitalia.com.
- 2026-06-23 — Local git initialized and pushed to GitHub remote at
  https://github.com/marvistaCI/cremaitalia-shopify (private). Use `git push` to back up
  changes after any meaningful edit.
- 2026-06-23 — Confirmed theme is intentionally minimal: 9 files, ~974 lines total.
  Active layout is `layout/password.liquid` (renders when password protection is on,
  which it currently is). `layout/theme.liquid` will activate after launch. No
  `sections/` or `snippets/` folders exist yet — to be added when building out the full
  storefront post-launch.
- 2026-06-23 — `Horizon` theme (id #150473375913) sits unpublished on the store.
  This is Shopify's 2025 reference theme; useful pattern source when building cart
  drawers, product cards, and other commerce components post-launch. Do not modify it
  in-place — pull patterns out, don't edit Horizon itself.
- 2026-06-24 — Reconciled the coming-soon POC (it was half-wired from the Cowork
  session). Created the missing `templates/password.liquid` (the page Shopify actually
  serves while password protection is ON) holding the hero + email signup card. The
  signup form had been sitting in `templates/index.liquid`, which only renders AFTER
  launch — so visitors couldn't see it. Aligned markup with the existing CSS/JS
  (`.signup-form`, `.form-error`, `.form-success`) so the validation/double-submit/
  screen-reader script is now live instead of dead. Added `snippets/ci-footer.liquid`
  as the single source of truth for the footer (fixes the missing `cremaitalia.com`
  line and the dead `#` links on the 404). Trimmed ~150 lines of CSS that styled
  sections which don't exist yet. Added a discreet collapsible password-entry box so
  password-holders can preview. Filled in the empty `settings_schema.json` theme_info.
  `index.liquid` remains a clean placeholder for the future full storefront mockup.
- 2026-06-27 — Canonical full-storefront specs received and committed to `docs/`:
  `CremaItalia_ClaudeCode_Brief_v1.md` (HOW: stack, metafields, templates, 10-phase
  build order), `CremaItalia_ShopifyMagic_Prompt_v1.md` (business logic: shelves,
  pricing formula, discounts, shipping, the Promise), and `CremaItalia_POC_v2.html`
  (design/UX source of truth). These SUPERSEDE the earlier v1 draft. Build a CUSTOM
  Liquid theme (no starter). New since v1: nav = Shop · Trovare · La Bottega · About;
  3-axis filter (Region × Shelf × Taste Profile); first-visit taste quiz; custom
  account portal; per-shelf product templates; `crema_italia.*` metafields; pricing
  formula (EUR×0.60×markup×1.165). See `docs/storefront-plan.md` for the reconciliation
  and OPEN QUESTIONS (esp. subscription engine: brief says Recharge/Skio, which
  conflicts with the 2026-06-24 "Shopify Subscriptions free" choice — unresolved).
- 2026-06-29 — **v3 specs supersede everything above.** New authoritative sources:
  `docs/CremaItalia_POC_v3.html` (design/UX source of truth — nav is now
  **Shop ▾ · Roasters · About · Journal · Bottega**, NOT the v2 Trovare/La Bottega nav),
  `Operations/In USA/shopify/Initial Site Build Out/Shopify_Magic_Build_Prompt_v3_FINAL.txt`
  (locked business rules), `00_PROJECT_BRIEF.md` (single source of truth),
  `Operations/In USA/shopify/Crema_Italia_Commerce_Playbook_v3.docx`. Conflict rule from
  Steve: **POC v3 + Magic Build Prompt v3 FINAL win.** Resolved by that rule:
  (a) **custom Liquid theme** (Steve's direct instruction + this file) over the
  Magic-Prompt/brief "use Dawn" line; (b) **Lora** display font (POC v3's `:root` still
  names Cormorant Garamond — stale token — but Magic Prompt + brand.css lock Lora);
  (c) **pricing = `SKU_LAST_COST × Markup[shelf/size]`** with the Magic-Prompt matrix
  (Commerce Playbook's `EUR×0.60×markup×1.165` + its different matrix and Sorpresa
  subscription are SUPERSEDED); Sorpresa is one-time-only, 100g-in-Tours-only.
- 2026-06-29 — **Subscription engine LOCKED: Loop.** Steve is going live with Loop.
  Loop is Shopify-native (selling plans + Shopify Checkout), so theme-level subscription
  code = native `selling_plan_groups` (no rewrite risk vs. "engine-agnostic"). What Loop
  changes: Roccia cadences modelled as 4/6/8-week selling plans; the account
  subscription-management page is a **Loop-hosted portal slot** (theme app block /
  passwordless login), NOT a hand-built pause/skip/swap engine. Subscriber 10% /
  Founding 12% remain Shopify Functions regardless. Recharge/Skip from the brief are off.
- 2026-06-29 — **Built POC3: the custom Liquid storefront.** Approach = a single-document
  SPA (`templates/index.liquid`, client-side `showPage`) rendered by `layout/theme.liquid`,
  with the test catalog **baked into `assets/ci-catalog.json`** (5 roasters, 9 Roccia
  SKUs, 1 Sorpresa Tour, 2 Selezione, 1 Offerta example, 4 Bottega) and rendered by
  `assets/ci-storefront.js`. Cart/checkout are **mocked** (no real Shopify cart yet);
  sign-in/account/Loop portal are **stubs** with `<!-- PROD -->` / `<!-- LOOP -->` seams.
  New files: `assets/ci-storefront.css|js`, `assets/ci-catalog.json`, `assets/ci-logo*`/
  favicons, `snippets/ci-header|ci-store-footer|ci-profile-banner|ci-quiz-modal|ci-signin-modal`.
  Coming-soon page (`layout/password.liquid` + `crema-italia.css|js`) left UNTOUCHED so the
  pre-launch gate still works. `shopify theme check`: 0 errors (11 warnings: Google-Fonts
  RemoteAsset + benign orphaned-snippet flags). Committed; NOT pushed to Shopify.
- 2026-06-29 — **POC3 pushed to an UNPUBLISHED preview theme** (Steve approved a
  login-gated preview). Theme: **"Crema Italia POC3 Preview"** id **151277174953** on
  `crema-italia.myshopify.com`. Live `crema-italia-coming-soon-theme` (#150557294761)
  is untouched and still the published theme. Preview is gated behind the store
  password (storefront protection ON) and/or the Shopify admin login.
  Preview URL: `https://crema-italia.myshopify.com?preview_theme_id=151277174953`
  Editor: `https://crema-italia.myshopify.com/admin/themes/151277174953/editor`
  To refresh the preview after edits: `shopify theme push --theme 151277174953`.
- 2026-07-01 — **Artist rebrand: finalized logo + revised palette/type adopted.** A human
  graphic artist delivered the finished mark (`Crema Italia Logo Files.zip`) — the durable
  vector master (`.ai`) + matched EPS/PDF/SVG/PNG in main/horizontal/favicon lockups,
  light + dark, ready for the USPTO TM filing. Actions: (a) archived the prior artwork to
  `Brand and Marketing/_Archive/Pre-Artist_2026-07/` (provenance MANIFEST); (b) restructured
  `Brand and Marketing/Logo Assets/` to the artist's layout (Art Files/EPS/PDF/SVG/PNG/Web)
  with a canonical README — new set fully supersedes old; removed old flat logos, TM
  Placement Options, Standard Company Logo (all archived). **Palette revised:** Espresso
  Brown `#3B1F12`→`#55331B`, Crema Gold `#C46A1F`→`#B88348` (Green/Red/Cream unchanged).
  **Type revised:** wordmark = Montecatini Pro (commercial, outlined in art); web/doc
  display = **Marcellus** (Google) — supersedes the Cormorant→Lora saga entirely; body =
  Inter. Propagated tokens through both theme worlds: `assets/ci-storefront.css`,
  `assets/crema-italia.css` (live coming-soon), `assets/ci-catalog.json`, and the Google
  Fonts loads in `layout/theme.liquid` + `layout/password.liquid`; swapped theme logo
  images (`ci-logo.png`=horizontal, `ci-logo-knockout.png`=dark main, favicons, apple-touch,
  `ci-og-image.png`, orphaned `ci-logo.svg`=new horizontal vector). Updated canonical
  `Brand and Marketing/Crema Italia Brand CSS.css` (v1.1→v1.2). **NOT pushed to Shopify**
  (live coming-soon page tokens changed but not deployed — needs Steve's push approval).
  **Follow-ups:** (1) verify Montecatini Pro licensing; (2) rebuild Brand Standards PDF on
  the new palette/type; (3) re-derive interim tints `#6B4A38`/`#E8A86A`/hover `#9C6E3C`.

---

## 10. Open questions / TODO

**CURRENT STATUS (as of 2026-06-29) — read this first when resuming.**

**POC3 is built.** A custom Liquid storefront (single-document SPA) exists in
`templates/index.liquid` + `layout/theme.liquid`, driven by `assets/ci-catalog.json`
(baked-in test data) and `assets/ci-storefront.css|js`. It is **committed to git, NOT
pushed to Shopify.** The coming-soon gate (`layout/password.liquid`) is untouched and
still active. Cart/checkout are mocked; sign-in/account/Loop portal are stubs.

**Steve's plan:** vet POC3 thoroughly, iron out kinks, THEN build the real production
store on the validated structure (real products + `crema_italia.*` metafields, real
Shopify cart + Checkout, Loop selling plans + hosted portal, Shopify Functions discounts).

**To preview POC3:** it must stay behind a login (store not live). Options —
`shopify theme dev` (local, auth-gated) or `shopify theme push --unpublished` (hidden
preview theme). **Do not push to Shopify without asking Steve first.**

**To resume, read in this order:** `docs/CremaItalia_POC_v3.html` (design/UX source of
truth) → `Shopify_Magic_Build_Prompt_v3_FINAL.txt` (locked rules) → `00_PROJECT_BRIEF.md`
(single source of truth) → this decision log (2026-06-29 entries).

**RESOLVED decisions:** subscription engine = **Loop** (locked); theme = **custom
Liquid**; display font = **Lora**; pricing = Magic-Prompt markup matrix; nav =
**Shop ▾ · Roasters · About · Journal · Bottega**; quiz + taste profile = in scope.

**OPEN / TO VET on POC3:**
- [ ] Walk every page + interaction; collect kink list (Steve + Claude).
- [ ] Confirm catalog test data (names, prices, copy) reads right.
- [ ] **Discounting rules** — display logic in cart matches Magic-Prompt v3 (subscriber
  10% / Founding 12% on Roccia·Sorpresa·Selezione only; +5% first-order stack; never
  Offerta/Bottega). Verify before hardcoding anything in production.
- [ ] Decide preview delivery (local dev vs unpublished theme) and whether to push.

**NEXT STEP (production build, after POC3 is vetted):** follow the brief's phase
sequence — real product/collection/metafield data model, per-shelf product templates,
native selling_plan_groups (Loop) on Roccia, Shopify Functions for discounts, real cart
+ Checkout. Reuse POC3's CSS/JS/markup as the design system.

## 12. When unsure

If a design decision isn't covered above, the order of authority is:
1. The brand standards PDF (canonical)
2. The brand CSS file (canonical for code-level values)
3. The voice & tone section of this file
4. The principle: "fewer elements, more whitespace, smaller logo, larger margins"

When unsure on a meaningful code change, ask Steve first. He'll likely have a strong
view, and he prefers being asked over being surprised.
